# Loser

### Finally!! 
An app for all the Jerry's in your life. Whisper "loser" at all the people who need to hear it.

Inspiration comes from S3E2 of Rick and Morty and the once-popular [Shame Bell](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shame-bell-tap-to-shame-swing-to-ring/id1011174584?mt=8) app.

All of the art was made in photoshop. Check out [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8yH8frsofo) for the lettering. The Jerry mytholog was drawn primarily with the freeform pen tool with the curve fit set to 10 px. The icon sizing was done by feeding a 1024x1024 icon to [www.appicon.build](www.appicon.build).

#### And that's the waaaaaaay the news goes

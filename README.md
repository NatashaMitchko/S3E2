# Loser

Finally! An app for all the Jerry's in your life. An app that let's you whisper "loser" at all the people who need to hear it.

Inspiration comes from S3E2 of Rick and Morty and the ever-popular [Shame Bell](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shame-bell-tap-to-shame-swing-to-ring/id1011174584?mt=8) app.

Art was made in photoshop. Check out [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8yH8frsofo) for the lettering and the cartoon was made primarily with the freeform pen tool with the curve fit set to 10 px.
